Benefits of using meta tags:-

Improved Search Engine Ranking:
 Meta tags, such as meta title and meta description, can improve a website's visibility and ranking in search engine results pages (SERPs) by providing relevant and optimized information for search engines to index.

Control over Website Preview: 
Meta tags allow website owners to control how their site appears in search results and on social media platforms. This can influence click-through rates and user engagement.

Communication with Web Crawlers: 
Meta tags provide additional information to web crawlers and search engines about the content, purpose, and structure of a web page, which can help in better indexing and categorization.

Enhanced User Experience: 
Well-crafted meta tags can provide users with clear and concise information about the content of a web page before they click on it, leading to a more satisfying user experience.

Differentiation from Competitors:
 Effective use of meta tags can differentiate a website from its competitors and attract the attention of potential visitors.
