-> SEO - 
       SEO stands for “search engine optimization.” In simple terms, SEO means the process of improving your website to increase its visibility in Google, Microsoft Bing, and other search engines whenever people search for:

Products you sell.
Services you provide.
Information on topics in which you have deep expertise and/or experience.

The better visibility your pages have in search results, the more likely you are to be found and clicked on. Ultimately, the goal of search engine optimization is to help attract website visitors who will become customers, clients or an audience that keeps coming back.

-> Importance of SEO

1) Visibility and Rankings -
When searching for a service or product online, users are more likely to choose one of the top five suggestions that the search engine shows them

2) Web Traffic -
To put it simply—if potential customers can’t find your website, you miss out on sales opportunities. SEO increases your organic search engine traffic, in turn increasing the number of visitors your website sees each day. This directly correlates to an increase in sales—because the more relevant people see your site, the more chances you have to sell to them. 

3) Trustworthy -
The better optimized your site is, the higher you’ll appear on search engines like Google and Bing. While ranking higher on Google is appealing to all brands because of increased visibility, a secondary benefit is the trust you gain with potential customers.

4) User Experience -
A well-optimized website clearly communicates what product or service is being offered, shows how to obtain it, and answers any questions surrounding it.

5) Growth - 
There’s no doubt about it—SEO carries a lot of importance for the growth of your brand. As we mentioned above, the higher you rank on a search engine for a variety of high-volume keywords, the more organic (aka non-paid) web traffic your site will receive. It’s as simple as that.
